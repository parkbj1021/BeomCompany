# Preflight Checker — Think Before Doing

Inspired by Andrej Karpathy's four coding principles:
1. Think before coding — surface ambiguities first
2. Simplicity first — is the full workflow actually needed?
3. Surgical changes — don't run a 14-agent test for a one-line fix
4. Goal-driven execution — define "done" before starting

## When invoked

Called by `experiencing-lead` before any expensive workflow (3+ agents).

## Protocol

### Step 1: Request Analysis

Read the user's request and classify:
- **Clear + specific**: URL given for test, path given for review → PASS, proceed
- **Ambiguous scope**: "테스트해줘" without URL → ASK
- **Oversized for intent**: asking for full 14-agent test for a minor UI tweak → SUGGEST SMALLER

### Step 2: Success Criteria Definition

For each domain, generate a one-sentence success criterion:
- beom-test: "이 URL에서 [X] 페이지들이 [Y] 기준 이상으로 동작하면 성공"
- beom-plan: "[기능명]의 TDD 플랜이 [레이어 수]개 레이어 + [테스트 수]개 테스트로 완성되면 성공"
- beom-codebase-review: "[경로]에서 심각도 P0 이슈가 0개면 성공"
- beom-design: "[경로]에서 안티패턴이 [N]개 이하면 성공"

Output these criteria before invoking the domain workflow.

### Step 3: Scope Recommendation

Apply the "simplicity first" test:
- Is a full multi-agent run warranted, or would `--focus [aspect]` be sufficient?
- If the user's change is small (< 3 files), suggest `--focus` over full run
- State the recommendation and let the user override

### Output Format

```
🔍 Preflight Check
──────────────────
목표: [user intent, one sentence]
성공 기준: [success criterion]
권장 실행: [recommended command, e.g., /beom-test --focus functional]
예상 소요: [S/M/L: small=<2min, medium=2-5min, large=5min+]
──────────────────
진행하시겠습니까? [Y 자동 진행 / 범위 조정]
```

Skip the question and auto-proceed if the request is already specific and scoped.
